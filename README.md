Meagen &amp; Dieter's ModSim Project 1

### How to work with it

#### Getting Setup
1. Fork it by clicking "fork" in the top right
2. Go to https://github.com/{yourusername}/pHandDying
3. click "Clone or Download" and then "HTTPS"
4. copy the text in the box directly below it
5. launch jupyter and open a new jupyter terminal
6. use ```cd``` and ```ls``` to navigate to the directory where you want to
   place the folder you will be downloading.
7. run ```git clone {paste or write the url}``` to download the folder
8. navigate to it in the jupyter documents view and launch it to start editing

#### Making changes to your fork

1. make changes to your notebook, and make sure to press the "save" icon in the
   top right of jupyter
2. open a terminal in jupyter
3. navigate to the folder that contains the notebook, using terminal commands ```cd``` 
   to change directory and ```ls``` to list what is in a directory.
4. run the command ```git add {filename}```, where "{filename}" is the name of
   the notebook you've been editing. Make sure to add the extension that goes
   after the dot. This adds the file to the list of things we want to group
   together and upload to github.
5. run the command ```git commit -m "{what did you do}"``` to group these
   changes together into a commit. In the area that says "{what did you do}",
   type a brief description of what changes you made in the notebook(s).
6. run the command ```git push``` to upload the files to github. It may ask you
   for your username and password for github. If so, enter them.
7. Done!

#### my repo vs your fork
You can always find the current state of my notebook (my repo) by going to https://github.com/Inkering/pHandDying .
Your fork can be found at https://github.com/{yourusername}/pHandDying

#### deleting a fork
If for some reason you feel the need to delete your repo (you probaby won't need to), you can do so by:
* go to the repo on github (your fork)
* click on "settings" in the navigation bar, it will be next to "insights"
* scroll down, and click on "delete this repository". It will make you type the
  name of the repo as confirmation that really want to delete it.

Eventually, we'll merge changes between the two "repos" so that we are all updated.
